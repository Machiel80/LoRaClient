# LoRaClient
This is a csharp client library build to simplify the usage of the Actility Api which is available for the Kpn LoRa network. It is not yet complete but offers the most common functions.  

The client is published as a [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kpn.LoRa.Client/](NuGet package) and the source code is shared on GitHub. 

In this repository you can also find the stub api which fakes some of the behavior of the actual Actility platform.
